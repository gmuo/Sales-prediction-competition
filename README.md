This was a final project of a machine learning subject at NTNU during my erasmus exchange in Norway. It consisted on a Kaggle competition on sales predictions of Norwegian stores all over the country. The main challenge was to obtain the best feauture extraction out of a group of datasets about the populations, malls and bus stops.
